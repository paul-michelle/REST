# UN Street Food Incentive
#### Back-end for the project's software support

### INTRO
The UN project us supposed to `improve the street food catering` of a country
by giving a customer an opportunity to assess the quality of the street
food vendors of their country/town of residence. Since those using the software
support of the UN incentive (which is the app in question here) may leave their
complaints (so called 'flags'), it is expected that the overall quality of the services
will rise. 

Each `stack-holder is given a particular role` on the software platform which
is being developed: customers, operators, managers, and - last not least -
vendor themselves.

### BACK_END's GOAL
The back-end part of the software shall guarantee `efficient saving, storing, and 
providing` on demand the information on all the stack-holders using the app, with 
reference to their roles and, therefore, `access control levels`.

### BACK_END's STACK

The back-end support is written in Python, with `Django Rest Framework`
on top of `Django3`, feat `MongoDB` and `PostgreSQL`.

Other technologies: `Selenium`, `Celery`, `Docker`.

The code is to be DRY, self-documented, and covered with tests,
making for easier maintenance in the future.
